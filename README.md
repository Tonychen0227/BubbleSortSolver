# Bubble Sort Solver
This is a solver for the game [Bubble Sort](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RoshanGames.BubbleSort&hl=en_CA) that was inspired after finding some very tricky levels. 

The idea of this is solver is to solve any puzzle in this game, using the idea of trees and breadth-first search.

## The Game Itself
See below for a screenshot of a sample stage (this here is an extremely tricky one):
